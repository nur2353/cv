            can only happen if we understand the way corruption works and the systems that enable it. in business, government, the courts, the media, and in civil society, as well as across all sectors from health and education to infrastructure and sports.Corruption
            happens in the shadows, often with the help of professional enablers such as bankers, lawyers, accountants and real estate agents, opaque financial systems and anonymous shell companies that allow corruption schemes to flourish and the corrupt

            Transparency is all about knowing who, why, what, how and how much. It means shedding light on formal and informal rules, plans, processes and actions. Transparency helps us, the public, hold all power to account for the common good.Seeking and receiving
            information is a human right that can act as a safeguard against corruption, and increase trust in decision makers and public institutions. However, transparency is not only about making information available, but ensuring it can be easily
            accessed, understood and used by citizens.
